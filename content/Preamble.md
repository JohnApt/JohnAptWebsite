Every tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) has a great challenge to meet; the TTRPG must facilitate [roleplaying](General\Roleplay.md) while simultaneously providing a system of rules to emulate a smooth game-like experience.

This system aims to minimally constrain your worldâ€™s lore, mechanics, and magic systems by:

* Having minimal [Flavor Text](Unsorted\Flavor%20Text.md) in the core module.
* Having an easy to use [Spells](General\Spells.md) and [Action Creation System](Players\Action%20Creation%20System.md).

This system also aims to disambiguate roleplay from game mechanics in a way that allows the two to happen in parallel naturally by:

* Having a [3.5 Phase System](General\3.5%20Phase%20System\3.5%20Phase%20System.md).
* Having a well defined set of terms listed in the [Glossary](Glossary.md).
* Having a meaningful [Resources](General\Resources\Resources.md) management system.
